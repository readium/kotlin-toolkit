# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Take a look at [the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md) to upgrade between two major versions.

**Warning:** Features marked as *experimental* may change or be removed in a future release without notice. Use with caution.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

#### Navigator

* Fixed crash in the image navigator.


## [3.0.0]

### Fixed

#### Navigator

* Fixed computing the total progression of audiobook locators.
* Fixed starting the TTS from the current resource in a fixed-layout EPUB.


## [3.0.0-beta.2]

### Added

#### Navigator

* Added `ExoPlayerDataSourceProvider` to implement resource caching with the media3 audio navigator. 

#### LCP

* A new `LcpService.retrieveLicenseDocument()` API can be used to read the LCPL embedded in a ZIP package.

### Changed

#### Navigator

* EPUB: The `scroll` preference is now forced to `true` when rendering vertical text (e.g. CJK vertical). [See this discussion for the rationale](https://github.com/readium/swift-toolkit/discussions/370).

### Fixed

#### Shared

* Fixed concurrent access when streaming a ZIP container.

#### Navigator

* Optimized scrolling to an EPUB text-based locator if it contains a CSS selector.
* Fixed applying the PSPDFKit reading progression preference on configuration changes.


## [3.0.0-beta.1]

### Deprecated

#### Navigator

* All the `completion` parameters of the `Navigator` APIs are removed.

### Changed

* All the APIs using or returning a `Date` objects are now using a custom `Instant` type. 

#### Shared

* The `Link` property key for archive-based publication assets (e.g. an EPUB/ZIP) is now `https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/properties#archive` instead of `archive`.

#### LCP

* [#493](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/discussions/493) The LCP module does not require the Bluetooth permissions anymore to derive the device name.

### Fixed

#### Navigator

* [#325](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/issues/325) Top EPUB selections no longer break when dragging the selection handles.
* Fixed applying preferences while the EPUB navigator fragment is being recreated.


## [3.0.0-alpha.2]

### Added

#### Navigator

* The new `HyperlinkNavigator.Listener.shouldFollowInternalLink(Link, LinkContext?)` allows you to handle footnotes according to your preference.
    * By default, the navigator now moves to the footnote content instead of displaying a pop-up as it did in version 2.x.

#### LCP

* You can use `LcpService.injectLicenseDocument()` to insert an LCPL into a package, if you downloaded it manually instead of using `LcpService.acquirePublication()`.

### Deprecated

#### Shared

* The `DownloadManager` introduced in version 3.0.0-alpha.1 has been removed due to the Android Download Manager introducing unnecessary complexities in the toolkit. Instead, we chose to enable apps to manually handle an LCP download with `LcpService.injectLicenseDocument()`.


## [3.0.0-alpha.1]

:warning: Please consult [the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md#300-alpha1) to assist you in handling the breaking changes in this latest major release.

### Added

#### Shared

* A new `Format` type was introduced to augment `MediaType` with more precise information about the format specifications of an `Asset`.
* The `DownloadManager` interface handles HTTP downloads. Components like the `LcpService` rely on it for downloading publications. Readium v3 ships with two implementations:
    * `ForegroundDownloadManager` uses an `HttpClient` to download files while the app is running.
    * `AndroidDownloadManager` is built upon [Android's `DownloadManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager) to manage HTTP downloads, even when the application is closed. It allows for resuming downloads after losing connection.
* The default `ZipArchiveOpener` now supports streaming ZIP archives, which enables opening a packaged publication (e.g. EPUB or LCP protected audiobook):
    * served by a remote HTTP server,
    * accessed through an Android `ContentProvider`, such as the shared storage.

#### Navigator

* Support for keyboard events in the EPUB, PDF and image navigators. See `VisualNavigator.addInputListener()`.

#### LCP

* You can now stream an LCP protected publication using its LCP License Document. This is useful for example to read a large audiobook without downloading it on the device first.
* The hash of protected publications is now verified upon download.

### Changed

* :warning: To avoid conflicts when merging your app resources, all resources declared in the Readium toolkit now have the prefix `readium_`. This means that you must rename any layouts or strings you have overridden. Some resources were removed from the toolkit. Please consult [the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md#300-alpha1).
* Most APIs now return an `Error` instance instead of an `Exception` in case of failure, as these objects are not thrown by the toolkit but returned as values

#### Shared

* :warning: To improve the interoperability with other Readium toolkits (in particular the Readium Web Toolkits, which only work in a streaming context) **Readium v3 now generates and expects valid URLs** for `Locator` and `Link`'s `href`. **You must migrate the HREFs or Locators stored in your database**, please consult [the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md#300-alpha1).
* `Link.href` and `Locator.href` are now respectively `Href` and `Url` objects. If you still need the string value, you can call `toString()`
* `MediaType` no longer has static helpers for sniffing it from a file or URL. Instead, you can use an `AssetRetriever` to retrieve the format of a file.

#### Navigator

* Version 3 includes a new component called `DirectionalNavigationAdapter` that replaces `EdgeTapNavigation`. This helper enables users to navigate between pages using arrow and space keys on their keyboard or by tapping the edge of the screen.
* The `onTap` and `onDrag` events of `VisualNavigator.Listener` have been deprecated. You can now use multiple implementations of `InputListener` with `VisualNavigator.addInputListener()`.

#### Streamer

* The `Streamer` object has been deprecated in favor of components with smaller responsibilities: `AssetRetriever` and `PublicationOpener`.

#### LCP

* `LcpService.acquirePublication()` is deprecated in favor of `LcpService.publicationRetriever()`, which provides greater flexibility thanks to the `DownloadManager`.
* The way the host view of a `LcpDialogAuthentication` is retrieved was changed to support Android configuration changes.

### Deprecated

* Both the Fuel and Kovenant libraries have been completely removed from the toolkit. With that, several deprecated functions have also been removed.

#### Shared

* The `putPublication` and `getPublication` helpers in `Intent` are deprecated. Now, it is the application's responsibility to pass `Publication` objects between activities and reopen them when necessary.

#### Navigator

* EPUB external links are no longer handled by the navigator. You need to open the link in your own Web View or Chrome Custom Tab.


## [2.4.1]

### Added

#### LCP

* [#509](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/issues/509) Support for the new 2.x LCP Profiles.


## [2.4.0]

* Readium is now distributed with [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.readium.kotlin-toolkit). Take a look at [the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md#240) to update your Gradle configuration.

### Added

#### Navigator

* The EPUB `backgroundColor` preference is now available with fixed-layout publications.
* New `EPUBNavigatorFragment.Configuration.useReadiumCssFontSize` option to revert to the 2.2.0 strategy for setting the font size of reflowable EPUB publications.
    * The native font size strategy introduced in 2.3.0 uses the Android web view's [`WebSettings.textZoom`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings#setTextZoom(int)) property to adjust the font size. 2.2.0 was using Readium CSS's [`--USER__fontSize` variable](https://readium.org/readium-css/docs/CSS12-user_prefs.html#font-size).
    * `WebSettings.textZoom` will work with more publications than `--USER__fontSize`, even the ones poorly authored. However the page width is not adjusted when changing the font size to keep the optimal line length.
* Scroll mode: jumping between two EPUB resources with a horizontal swipe triggers the `Navigator.Listener.onJumpToLocator()` callback.
    * This can be used to allow the user to go back to their previous location if they swiped across chapters by mistake.
* Support for non-linear EPUB resources with an opt-in in reading apps (contributed by @chrfalch in [#375](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/pull/375) and [#376](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/pull/376)).
     1. Override loading non-linear resources with `VisualNavigator.Listener.shouldJumpToLink()`.
     2. Present a new `EpubNavigatorFragment` by providing a custom `readingOrder` with only this resource to the constructor.
* Added dummy navigator fragment factories to prevent crashes caused by Android restoring the fragments after a process death.
    * To use it, set the dummy fragment factory when you don't have access to the `Publication` instance. Then, either finish the `Activity` or pop the fragment from the UI before it resumes.
        ```kotlin
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            val publication = model.publication ?: run {
                childFragmentManager.fragmentFactory = EpubNavigatorFragment.createDummyFactory()
                super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

                requireActivity().finish()
                // or
                navController?.popBackStack()

                return
            }

            // Create the real navigator factory as usual...
        }
        ```

#### Streamer

* The EPUB content iterator now returns `audio` and `video` elements.

### Changed

* Readium resources are now prefixed with `readium_`. Take care of updating any overridden resource by following [the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md#300).
* `Link` and `Locator`'s `href` are normalized as valid URLs to improve interoperability with the Readium Web toolkits.
    * **You MUST migrate your database if you were persisting HREFs and Locators**. Take a look at [the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md) for guidance.

#### Shared

* `Publication.localizedTitle` is nullable, as we cannot guarantee that all publication sources offer a title.
* The `MediaType` sniffing helpers are deprecated in favor of `MediaTypeRetriever` (for media type and file extension hints and raw content) and `AssetRetriever` (for URLs). 

#### Navigator

* `EpubNavigatorFragment.firstVisibleElementLocator()` now returns the first *block* element that is visible on the screen, even if it starts on previous pages.
    * This is used to make sure the user will not miss any context when restoring a TTS session in the middle of a resource.
* The `VisualNavigator`'s drag and tap listener events are moved to a new `addInputListener()` API.
* The new `DirectionalNavigationAdapter` component replaces `EdgeTapNavigation`, helping you turn pages with the arrow and space keyboard keys, or taps on the edge of the screen.

### Deprecated

#### Shared

* `DefaultHttClient.additionalHeaders` is deprecated. Set all the headers when creating a new `HttpRequest`, or modify outgoing requests in `DefaultHttpClient.Callback.onStartRequest()`.

#### Navigator

* All the navigator `Activity` are deprecated in favor of the `Fragment` variants.

#### Streamer

* The `Fetcher` interface was deprecated in favor of the `Container` one in `readium-shared`.

### Fixed

#### Navigator

* [#360](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/issues/360) Fix EPUB JavaScript interface injection when rotating the screen on some devices.

#### Streamer

* Fixed issue with the TTS starting from the beginning of the chapter instead of the current position.

## [2.3.0]

### Added

#### Shared

* Extract the raw content (text, images, etc.) of a publication. [Take a look at the user guide](docs/guides/content.md).
* Add support for unsafe HTTP redirections with `DefaultHttpClient`.
    * You will need to opt-in explicitly by implementing `DefaultHttpClient.Callback.onFollowUnsafeRedirect`.

#### Navigator

* Improved Javascript support in the EPUB navigator:
    * Register custom [JavascriptInterface](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/JavascriptInterface) objects to inject native Kotlin code in the EPUB web views.
        ```kotlin
        EpubNavigatorFragment.createFactory(
            publication = publication,
            …,
            config = EpubNavigatorFragment.Configuration().apply {
                registerJavascriptInterface("customInterface") { link ->
                    MyCustomApi(link)
                }
            }
        )
        
        class MyCustomApi(val link: Link) {
            @JavascriptInterface
            fun api(arg: String): String {
                return "API called from the resource ${link.href} with argument $arg")
            }
        }
        ```
    * Evaluate JavaScript on the currently visible HTML resource with `EpubNavigatorFragment.evaluateJavascript()`.
        ```kotlin
        val result = navigator.evaluateJavascript("customInterface.api('argument')")
        ```
* New [PSPDFKit](readium/adapters/pspdfkit) adapter for rendering PDF documents. [Take a look at the user guide](docs/guides/pdf.md).
* [A brand new text-to-speech implementation](docs/guides/tts.md).
* [Support for custom fonts with the EPUB navigator](docs/guides/epub-fonts.md).
* New EPUB user preferences, as part of [the revamped Settings API](docs/guides/navigator-preferences.md):
    * `backgroundColor` - Default page background color.
    * `fontWeight` - Base text font weight.
    * `textColor` - Default page text color.
    * `textNormalization` - Normalize font style, weight and variants, which improves accessibility.
    * `imageFilter` - Filter applied to images in dark theme (darken, invert colors)
    * `language` - Language of the publication content.
    * `readingProgression` - Direction of the reading progression across resources, e.g. RTL.
    * `typeScale` - Scale applied to all element font sizes.
    * `paragraphIndent` - Text indentation for paragraphs.
    * `paragraphSpacing` - Vertical margins for paragraphs.
    * `hyphens` - Enable hyphenation.
    * `ligatures` - Enable ligatures in Arabic.
* Fixed scroll inertia when scrolling an EPUB.
* EPUB decorations can now be attached to `Locator` objects containing only an HTML ID (`locations.fragments`) or a CSS selector (`locations.cssSelector`).

### Changed

#### Shared

* `TransformingResource` now caches its content by default, as it is the correct behavior in most cases. Set `cacheBytes = false` explicitly to revert to the previous behavior.
* The previous PDF navigator was extracted in its own package to support third-party PDF engines. **This is a breaking change** if your app supported PDF, take a look at [the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md#230).

#### Navigator

* The EPUB and PDF user preferences API got revamped. [Take a look at the user guide](docs/guides/navigator-preferences.md) and the [migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md#230) to learn how to use it.
* `Decoration.extras` is now a `Map<String, Any>` instead of `Bundle`. You will need to update your app if you were storing custom data in `extras`, for example:
    ```kotlin
    val decoration = Decoration(...,
        extras = mapOf("id" to id)
    )

    val id = decoration.extras["id"] as? Long
    ```

### Deprecated

#### Streamer

* The local HTTP server is not needed anymore to render EPUB publications. [Take a look at the migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md#230).

### Fixed

#### Streamer

* Fixed parsing the table of contents of an EPUB 3 using NCX instead of a Navigation Document.

#### Navigator

* [swift-toolkit#61](https://github.com/readium/swift-toolkit/issues/61) Fixed serving EPUB resources when the HREF contains an anchor or query parameters.
* Fixed emitting `currentLocator` with fixed layout EPUBs.
* Prevent refreshing an already loaded EPUB resource when jumping to a `Locator` in it.
* [#86](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/issues/86) Fixed page swipes while selecting text in an EPUB resource.
* The `onTap` event is not sent when an EPUB text selection is active anymore, to prevent showing the app bar while dismissing a selection.
* [#76](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/issues/76) Fixed EPUB fixed layout font size affected by device settings.
* `Decoration` objects are now properly comparable with `equals()`.
* [#292](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/issues/292) Fix broken pagination when an EPUB uses `overflow-x: hidden`.


## [2.2.1]

### Fixed

#### Streamer

* [#286](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/issues/286) Fixed broken dependency to NanoHTTPD.


## [2.2.0]

### Added

#### Shared

* A new `Publication.conformsTo()` API to identify the profile of a publication.
* Support for the [`conformsTo` RWPM metadata](https://github.com/readium/webpub-manifest/issues/65), to identify the profile of a `Publication`.

#### Navigator

* The PDF navigator now honors the publication reading progression with support for right-to-left and horizontal scrolling.
    * The default (auto) reading progression for PDF is top-to-bottom, which is vertical scrolling.
* A new convenience utility `EdgeTapNavigation` to trigger page turns while tapping the screen edges.
    * It takes into account the navigator reading progression to move into the right direction.
    * Call it from the `VisualNavigator.Listener.onTap()` callback as demonstrated below:
    ```kotlin
    override fun onTap(point: PointF): Boolean {
        val navigated = edgeTapNavigation.onTap(point, requireView())
        if (!navigated) {
            // Fallback action, for example toggling the app bar.
        }
        return true
    }
    ```
* The new `Navigator.Listener.onJumpToLocator()` API is called every time the navigator jumps to an explicit location, which might break the linear reading progression.
    * For example, it is called when clicking on internal links or programmatically calling `Navigator.go()`, but not when turning pages.
    * You can use this callback to implement a navigation history by differentiating between continuous and discontinuous moves.
* You can now disable the display cutouts padding in the EPUB navigator (contributed by [@szymn](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/pull/101)).
    * This is useful when the navigator is not laid out full screen.
* (*experimental*) A new audiobook navigator based on Jetpack `media2`.
    * See the [pull request #80](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/pull/80) for the differences with the previous audiobook navigator.
    * This navigator is located in its own module `readium-navigator-media2`. You will need to add it to your dependencies to use it.
    * The Test App demonstrates how to use the new audiobook navigator, see `MediaService` and `AudioReaderFragment`.
* (*experimental*) The EPUB navigator now supports overridable drag gestures. See `VisualNavigator.Listener`.

### Deprecated

#### Shared

* `Publication.type` is now deprecated in favor of the new `Publication.conformsTo()` API which is more accurate.
    * For example, replace `publication.type == Publication.TYPE.EPUB` with `publication.conformsTo(Publication.Profile.EPUB)` before opening a publication with the `EpubNavigatorFragment`.
* `Link.toLocator()` is deprecated as it may create an incorrect `Locator` if the link `type` is missing.
    * Use `publication.locatorFromLink()` instead.

### Fixed

* Fix building with Kotlin 1.6.

#### Streamer

* Fixed the rendering of PDF covers in some edge cases.
* Fixed reading ranges of obfuscated EPUB resources.

#### Navigator

* Fixed turning pages of an EPUB reflowable resource with an odd number of columns. A virtual blank trailing column is appended to the resource when displayed as two columns.
* EPUB: Fallback on `reflowable` if the `presentation.layout` hint is missing from a manifest.
* EPUB: Offset of the current selection's `rect` to take into account the vertical padding.
* Improve backward compatibility of JavaScript files using Babel.
* [#193](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/issues/193) Fixed invisible `<audio>` elements.


## [2.1.1]

### Changed

#### Navigator

* Improve loading of EPUB reflowable resources.
    * Resources are hidden until fully loaded and positioned.
    * Intermediary locators are not broadcasted as `currentLocator` anymore while loading a resource.
    * Improved accuracy when jumping to the middle of a large resource.
    * `EpubNavigatorFragment.PaginationListener.onPageLoaded()` is now called only a single time, for the currently visible page.
    * `VisualNavigator.Listener.onTap()` is called even when a resource is not fully loaded.

### Fixed

#### Navigator

* `EpubNavigatorFragment`'s `goForward()` and `goBackward()` are now jumping to the previous or next pages instead of resources.
* [#20](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/issues/20) EPUB navigator stuck between two pages with vertical swipes.
* [#27](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/issues/27) Internal links break the EPUB navigator (contributed by [@mihai-wolfpack](https://github.com/readium/kotlin-toolkit/pull/28)).


## [2.1.0]

### Added

#### Shared

* (*experimental*) A new Publication `SearchService` to search through the resources' content, with a default implementation `StringSearchService`.
* `ContentProtection.Scheme` can be used to identify protection technologies using unique URI identifiers.
* `Link` objects from archive-based publication assets (e.g. an EPUB/ZIP) have additional properties for entry metadata.
    ```json
    "properties" {
        "archive": {
            "entryLength": 8273,
            "isEntryCompressed": true
        }
    }
    ```

#### Streamer

* EPUB publications implement a `SearchService` to search through the content.
* Known DRM schemes (LCP and Adobe ADEPT) are now sniffed by the `Streamer`, when no registered `ContentProtection` supports them.
    * This is helpful to present an error message when the user attempts to open a protected publication not supported by the app.

#### Navigator

* The EPUB navigator is now able to navigate to a `Locator` using its `text` context. This is useful for search results or highlights missing precise locations.
* Get or clear the current user selection of the navigators implementing `SelectableNavigator`.
* (*experimental*) Support for the [Decorator API](https://github.com/readium/architecture/pull/160) to draw user interface elements over a publication's content.
    * This can be used to render highlights over a text selection, for example.
    * For now, only the EPUB navigator implements `DecorableNavigator`, for reflowable publications. You can implement custom decoration styles with `HtmlDecorationTemplate`.
* Customize the EPUB selection context menu by providing a custom `ActionMode.Callback` implementation with `EpubNavigatorFragment.Configuration.selectionActionModeCallback`.
    * This is an alternative to overriding `Activity.onActionModeStarted()` which does not seem to work anymore with Android 12.
* (*experimental*) A new audiobook navigator based on Android's [`MediaSession`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media-apps/working-with-a-media-session).
    * It supports out-of-the-box media style notifications and background playback.
    * ExoPlayer is used by default for the actual playback, but you can use a custom player by implementing `MediaPlayer`.

#### OPDS

* New APIs using coroutines and R2's `HttpClient` instead of Fuel and kovenant (contributed by [@stevenzeck](https://github.com/readium/r2-opds-kotlin/pull/55)).

### Changed

* Upgraded to Kotlin 1.5.31 and Gradle 7.1.1

#### Streamer

* The default EPUB positions service now uses the archive entry length when available. [This is similar to how Adobe RMSDK generates page numbers](https://github.com/readium/architecture/issues/123).
    * To use the former strategy, create the `Streamer` with: `Streamer(parsers = listOf(EpubParser(reflowablePositionsStrategy = OriginalLength(pageLength = 1024))))`

#### Navigator

* The order of precedence of `Locator` locations in the reflowable EPUB navigator is: `text`, HTML ID, then `progression`. The navigator will now fallback on less precise locations in case of failure.

#### LCP

* Migrated to Jetpack Room for the SQLite database storing rights and passphrases (contributed by [@stevenzeck](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin/pull/116)).
    * Note that the internal SQL schema changed. You will need to update your app if you were querying the database manually.

### Fixed

#### Shared

* Crash with `HttpRequest.setPostForm()` on Android 6.
* HREF normalization when a resource path contains special characters.

#### Streamer

* EPUB style injection when a resource has a `<head>` tag with attributes.

#### Navigator

* When restoring a `Locator`, The PDF navigator now falls back on `locations.position` if the `page=` fragment identifier is missing.

#### OPDS

* Links in an OPDS 2 feed are normalized to the feed base URL.


## 2.0.0

### Added

#### Shared

* `HttpFetcher` is a new publication fetcher able to serve remote resources through HTTP.
    * The actual HTTP requests are performed with an instance of `HttpClient`.
* `HttpClient` is a new protocol exposing a high level API to perform HTTP requests.
    * `DefaultHttpClient` is an implementation of `HttpClient` using standard `HttpURLConnection` APIs. You can use `DefaultHttpClient.Callback` to customize how requests are created and even recover from errors, e.g. to implement Authentication for OPDS.
    * You can provide your own implementation of `HttpClient` to Readium APIs if you prefer to use a third-party networking library.

#### Streamer

* `Streamer` takes a new optional `HttpClient` dependency to handle HTTP requests.

### Fixed

#### Navigator

* Scrolling to an EPUB ID (e.g. from the table of contents) when the target spans several screens.

#### LCP

* [#267](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-kotlin/issues/267) Prints and copy characters left are now properly reported (contributed by [@qnga](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin/pull/104)).


## 2.0.0-beta.2

### Added

#### Shared

* `Publication.Service.Context` now holds a reference to the parent `Publication`. This can be used to access other services from a given `Publication.Service` implementation.
* The default `LocatorService` implementation can be used to get a `Locator` from a global progression in the publication.
  * `publication.locateProgression(0.5)`

#### Streamer

* `Server.addPublication()` is a new API which replaces `addEpub()` and is easier to use.
  * If the publication can be served, it will return the base URL which you need to provide to the Navigator `Activity` or `Fragment`.
  * You do not need to give the publication filename nor add the server port in the `$key-publicationPort` `SharedPreference` value anymore.

#### LCP

* You can observe the progress of an acquisition by providing an `onProgress` closure to `LcpService.acquirePublication()`.
* Extensibility in licenses' `Rights` model.

### Changed

#### Streamer

* The HTTP server now requests that publication resources are not cached by browsers.
  * Caching poses a security risk for protected publications.

#### Navigator

* `R2EpubActivity` and `R2AudiobookActivity` require a new `baseUrl` `Intent` extra. You need to set it to the base URL returned by `Server.addPublication()` from the Streamer.

#### LCP

* The Renew Loan API got revamped to better support renewal through a web page.
    * You will need to implement `LcpLicense.RenewListener` to coordinate the UX interaction.
    * If your application fits Material Design guidelines, take a look at `MaterialRenewListener` for a default implementation.
* Removed dependency on Joda's `DateTime` in public APIs.
    * You can always create a `DateTime` from the standard `Date` objects if you relied on Joda's features in the callers.

### Fixed

#### Shared

* [#129](https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-kotlin/issues/129) Improve performances when reading deflated ZIP resources.
  * For example, it helps with large image-based FXL EPUB which used to be slow to render.
* [#136](https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-kotlin/issues/136) `null` values in JSON string properties are now properly parsed as nullable types, instead of the string `"null"`

#### Navigator

* [#217](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-kotlin/issues/217) Interactive HTML elements are not bypassed anymore when handling touch gestures.
  * Scripts using `preventDefault()` are now taken into account and do not trigger a tap event anymore.
* [#150](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/issues/150) External links are opened in a Chrome Custom Tab instead of the navigator's web view.
* [#52](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/issues/52) Memory leak in EPUB web views. This fixes ongoing media playback when closing an EPUB.

#### LCP

* [#287](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-kotlin/issues/287) Make sure the passphrase input is visible on smaller devices in the authentication dialog.

* `PublicationAsset` is a new interface which can be used to open a publication from various medium, such as a file, a remote URL or a custom source.
  * `File` was replaced by `FileAsset`, which implements `PublicationAsset`.

#### Navigator

* Support for [display cutouts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/display-cutout) (screen notches).
    * **IMPORTANT**: You need to remove any `setPadding()` statement from your app in `UserSettings.kt`, if you copied it from the test app.
    * If you embed a navigator fragment (e.g. `EpubNavigatorFragment`) yourself, you need to opt-in by [specifying the `layoutInDisplayCutoutMode`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/display-cutout#choose_how_your_app_handles_cutout_areas) of the host `Activity`.
    * `R2EpubActivity` and `R2CbzActivity` automatically apply `LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_SHORT_EDGES` to their window's `layoutInDisplayCutoutMode`.
    * `PdfNavigatorFragment` is not yet compatible with display cutouts, because of limitations from the underlying PDF viewer.
* Customize EPUB vertical padding by overriding the `r2.navigator.epub.vertical_padding` dimension.
    * Follow [Android's convention for alternative resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources#AlternativeResources) to specify different paddings for landscape (`values-land`) or large screens.

### Changed

* Upgraded to Kotlin 1.4.10.

#### Shared

* `Format` got merged into `MediaType`, to simplify the media type APIs.
  * You can use `MediaType.of()` to sniff the type of a file or bytes.
      * All the `MediaType.of()` functions are now suspending to prevent deadlocks with `runBlocking`.
  * `MediaType` has now optional `name` and `fileExtension` properties.
  * Some publication formats can be represented by several media type aliases. Using `mediaType.canonicalMediaType()` will give you the canonical media type to use, for example when persisting the file type in a database. All Readium APIs are already returning canonical media types, so it only matters if you create a `MediaType` yourself from its string representation.
* `ContentLayout` is deprecated, use `publication.metadata.effectiveReadingProgression` to determine the reading progression of a publication instead.

#### Streamer

* `Streamer` is now expecting a `PublicationAsset` instead of a `File`. You can create custom implementations of `PublicationAsset` to open a publication from different medium, such as a file, a remote URL, in-memory bytes, etc.
  * `FileAsset` can be used to replace `File` and provides the same behavior.

#### Navigator

* All `utils.js` functions were moved under a `readium.` namespace. You will need to update your code if you were calling them manually.

### Fixed

#### LCP

* When acquiring a publication, falls back on the media type declared in the license link if the server returns an unknown media type.

#### Navigator

* EPUBs declaring multiple languages were laid out from right to left if the first language had an RTL reading
progression. Now if no reading progression is set, the `effectiveReadingProgression` will be LTR.
* [#152](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/issues/152) Panning through a zoomed-in fixed layout EPUB (contributed by [@johanpoirier](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/pull/172)).
* [#146](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/issues/146) Various reflowable EPUB columns shift issues.
* Restoring the last EPUB location after configuration changes (e.g. screen rotation).
* Edge taps to turn pages when the app runs in a multi-windows environment.


## 2.0.0-alpha.2

### Added

#### Shared

* The [Publication Services API](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/004-publication-helpers-services) allows to extend a `Publication` with custom implementations of known services. This version ships with a few predefined services:
  * `PositionsService` provides a list of discrete locations in the publication, no matter what the original format is.
  * `CoverService` provides an easy access to a bitmap version of the publication cover.
* The [Composite Fetcher API](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/002-composite-fetcher-api) can be used to extend the way publication resources are accessed.
* Support for exploded directories for any archive-based publication format.
* [Content Protection](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/006-content-protection) handles DRM and other format-specific protections in a more systematic way.
  * LCP now ships an `LcpContentProtection` implementation to be plugged into the `Streamer`.
  * You can add custom `ContentProtection` implementations to support other DRMs by providing an instance to the `Streamer`.

#### Streamer

* [Streamer API](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/005-streamer-api) offers a simple interface to parse a publication and replace standalone parsers.
* A generic `ImageParser` for bitmap-based archives (CBZ or exploded directories) and single image files.
* A generic `AudioParser` for audio-based archives (Zipped Audio Book or exploded directories) and single audio files.

#### Navigator

* Support for the new `Publication` model using the [Content Protection](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/006-content-protection) for DRM rights and the [Fetcher](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/002-composite-fetcher-api) for resource access.
* (*experimental*) New `Fragment` implementations as an alternative to the legacy `Activity` ones (contributed by [@johanpoirier](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/pull/148)).
  * The fragments are chromeless, to let you customize the reading UX.
  * To create the fragments use the matching factory such as `EpubNavigatorFragment.createFactory()`, as showcased in `R2EpubActivity`.
  * At the moment, highlights and TTS are not yet supported in the new EPUB navigator `Fragment`.
  * [This is now the recommended way to integrate Readium](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/issues/115) in your applications.

#### LCP

* LCP implementation of the [Content Protection API](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/006-content-protection) to work with the new [Streamer API](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/005-streamer-api) (contributed by [@qnga](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin/pull/79)).
  * It is highly recommended that you upgrade to the new `Streamer` API to open publications, which will simplify DRM unlocking.
* Two default implementations of `LcpAuthenticating`:
  * `LcpDialogAuthentication` to prompt the user for its passphrase with the official LCP dialog.
  * `LcpPassphraseAuthentication` to provide directly a passphrase, pulled for example from a database or a web service.
* `LcpService::isLcpProtected()` provides a way to check if a file is protected with LCP.
* All the `LcpException` errors are now implementing `UserException` and are suitable for user display. Use `getUserMessage()` to get the localized message.

### Changed

#### Shared

* [The `Publication` and `Container` types were merged together](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/003-publication-encapsulation) to offer a single interface to a publication's resources.
  * Use `publication.get()` to read the content of a resource, such as the cover. It will automatically be decrypted if a `ContentProtection` was attached to the `Publication`.

#### Streamer

* `Container` and `ContentFilters` were replaced by a shared implementation of a [`Fetcher`](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/002-composite-fetcher-api).

#### Navigator

* `currentLocator` is now a `StateFlow` instead of `LiveData`, to better support chromeless navigators such as an audiobook navigator.
  * If you were observing `currentLocator` in a UI context, you can continue to do so with `currentLocator.asLiveData()`.
* Improvements to the PDF navigator:
  * The navigator doesn't require PDF publications to be served from an HTTP server anymore. A side effect is that the navigator is now able to open larger PDF files.
  * `PdfNavigatorFragment.Listener::onResourceLoadFailed()` can be used to report fatal errors to the user, such as when trying to open a PDF document that is too large for the available memory.
  * A dedicated `PdfNavigatorFragment.createFactory()` was added, which deprecates the use of `NavigatorFragmentFactory`.

#### LCP

* The public API got modernized to be more Kotlin idiomatic (contributed by [@qnga](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin/pull/84)).
  * All asynchronous APIs are now suspending to take advantage of Kotlin's coroutines.
* `LcpAuthenticating` is now provided with more information and you will need to update any implementation you may have.
  * If you copied the default authentication dialog, it's recommended to use `LcpDialogAuthentication` instead.
* Publications are now downloaded to a temporary location, to make sure disk storage can be recovered automatically by the system. After acquiring the publication, you need to move the downloaded file to another permanent location.
* The private `liblcp` dependency is now accessed through reflection, to allow switching LCP dynamically (contributed by [@qnga](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin/pull/87)).
  * You need to add `implementation "readium:liblcp:1.0.0@aar"` to your `build.gradle`.
  * `LcpService::create()` returns `null` if `lcplib` is not found.

### Fixed

#### Shared

* `OutOfMemoryError` occuring while opening large publications are now caught to prevent crashes. They are reported as `Resource.Exception.OutOfMemory`.
* Readium can now open PDF documents of any size without crashing. However, LCP protected PDFs are still limited by the available memory.

#### Streamer

* Readium can now open PDF documents of any size without crashing. However, LCP protected PDFs are still limited by the available memory.
* Various HTTP server fixes and optimizations.

#### Navigator

* Prevent switching to the next resource by mistake when scrolling through an EPUB resource in scroll mode.

#### LCP

* Decrypting resources in some edge cases (contributed by [@qnga](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin/pull/84))
* Issues with LSD interactions:
  * Exceptions handling with `renew` and `return` interactions.
  * Presentation of the `renew` interaction through an HTML page.
* The timeout of fetching the License Status Document is reduced to 5 seconds, to avoid blocking a publication opening in low Internet conditions.


## 2.0.0-alpha.1

### Added

#### Shared

* Support for [Positions List](https://github.com/readium/architecture/tree/master/models/locators/positions), which provides a list of discrete locations in a publication and can be used to implement an approximation of page numbers.
  * Get the visible position from the current `Locator` with `locations.position`.
  * The total number of positions can be retrieved with `publication.positions().size`. It is a suspending function because computing positions the first time can be expensive. 
* The new [Format API](https://github.com/readium/architecture/blob/master/proposals/001-format-api.md) simplifies the detection of file formats, including known publication formats such as EPUB and PDF.
  * [A format can be "sniffed"](https://github.com/readium/architecture/blob/master/proposals/001-format-api.md#sniffing-the-format-of-raw-bytes) from files, raw bytes or even HTTP responses.
  * Reading apps are welcome to [extend the API with custom formats](https://github.com/readium/architecture/blob/master/proposals/001-format-api.md#supporting-a-custom-format).
  * Using `Link.mediaType.matches()` is now recommended [to safely check the type of a resource](https://github.com/readium/architecture/blob/master/proposals/001-format-api.md#mediatype-class).
  * [More details about the Kotlin implementation can be found in the pull request.](https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-kotlin/pull/100)
* In `Publication` shared models:
  * Support for the [Presentation Hints](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/extensions/presentation.html) extension.
  * Support for OPDS holds, copies and availability in `Link`, for library-specific features.
  * Readium Web Publication Manifest extensibility is now supported for `Publication`, `Metadata`, link's `Properties` and locator's `Locations`, which means that you are now able to access custom JSON properties in a manifest [by creating Kotlin extensions on the shared models](https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-kotlin/blob/a4e5b4461d6ce9f989a79c8f912f3cbdaff4667e/r2-shared/src/main/java/org/readium/r2/shared/publication/opds/Properties.kt#L16).

#### Streamer

* Support for [Positions List](https://github.com/readium/architecture/tree/master/models/locators/positions) with EPUB, CBZ and PDF. Positions provide a list of discrete locations in a publication and can be used to implement an approximation of page numbers.
  * Get the visible position from the current `Locator` with `locations.position`.
  * The total number of positions can be retrieved with `publication.positions().size`. It is a suspending function because computing positions the first time can be expensive. 
* `ReadiumWebPubParser` to parse all Readium Web Publication profiles, including [Audiobooks](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/extensions/audiobook.html), [LCP for Audiobooks](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/notes/lcp-for-audiobooks.html) and [LCP for PDF](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/notes/lcp-for-pdf.html). It parses both manifests and packages.
* (*experimental*) `PDFParser` to parse single PDF documents.
  * The PDF parser is based on [PdfiumAndroid](https://github.com/barteksc/PdfiumAndroid/), which may increase the size of your apps. Please open an issue if this is a problem for you, as we are considering different solutions to fix this in a future release.

#### Navigator

* The [position](https://github.com/readium/architecture/tree/master/models/locators/positions) is now reported in the locators for EPUB, CBZ and PDF.
* (*experimental*) [PDF navigator](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/pull/130).
  * Supports both single PDF and LCP protected PDF.
  * As a proof of concept, [it is implemented using `Fragment` instead of `Activity`](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/issues/115). `R2PdfActivity` showcases how to use the `PdfNavigatorFragment` with the new `NavigatorFragmentFactory`.
  * The navigator is based on [AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer), which may increase the size of your apps. Please open an issue if this is a problem for you, as we are considering different solutions to fix this in a future release.

#### LCP

* Support for [PDF](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/notes/lcp-for-pdf.html) and [Readium Audiobooks](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/notes/lcp-for-audiobooks.html) protected with LCP.

### Changed

#### Shared

* [The `Publication` shared models underwent an important refactoring](https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-kotlin/pull/88) and some of these changes are breaking. [Please refer to the migration guide to update your codebase](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-kotlin/blob/develop/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md).
  * All the models are now immutable data classes, to improve code safety. This should not impact reading apps unless you created `Publication` or other models yourself.
  * A few types and enums were renamed to follow the Google Android Style coding convention better. Just follow deprecation warnings to update your codebase.

#### Streamer

* The CSS, JavaScript and fonts injection in the `Server` was refactored to reduce the risk of collisions and simplify your codebase.
  * **This is a breaking change**, [to upgrade your app you need to](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-kotlin/pull/321/files#diff-9bb6ad21df8b48f171ba6266616662ac):
    * Provide the application's `Context` when creating a `Server`.
    * Remove the following injection statements, which are now handled directly by the Streamer:
        ```kotlin
        server.loadCustomResource(assets.open("scripts/crypto-sha256.js"), "crypto-sha256.js", Injectable.Script)   
        server.loadCustomResource(assets.open("scripts/highlight.js"), "highlight.js", Injectable.Script)
        ```

#### Navigator

* [Upgraded to Readium CSS 1.0.0-beta.1.](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/pull/134)
  * Two new fonts are available: AccessibleDfa and IA Writer Duospace.
  * The file structure now follows strictly the one from [ReadiumCSS's `dist/`](https://github.com/readium/readium-css/tree/master/css/dist), for easy upgrades and custom builds replacement.

#### LCP

* `LCPAuthenticating` can now return hashed passphrases in addition to clear ones. [This can be used by reading apps](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin/pull/64) fetching hashed passphrases from a web service or [Authentication for OPDS](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/notes/lcp-key-retrieval.html), for example.

### Deprecated

#### Shared

* `R2SyntheticPageList` was replaced by the aforementioned Positions List and can be safely removed from your codebase.

#### Navigator

* `Navigator.currentLocation` and `NavigatorDelegate.locationDidChange()` are deprecated in favor of a unified `Navigator.currentLocator`, which is observable thanks to `LiveData`.

### Fixed

#### Shared

* **Important:** [Publications parsed from large manifests could crash the application](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-kotlin/issues/286) when starting a reading activity. To fix this, **`Publication` must not be put in an `Intent` extra anymore**. Instead, [use the new `Intent` extensions provided by Readium](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-kotlin/pull/303). This solution is a crutch until [we move away from `Activity` in the Navigator](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/issues/115) and let reading apps handle the lifecycle of `Publication` themselves.
* [The local HTTP server was broken](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-kotlin/pull/306) when provided with publication filenames containing invalid characters.
* XML namespace prefixes are now properly supported when an author chooses unusual ones (contributed by [@qnga](https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-kotlin/pull/85)).
* The `AndroidManifest.xml` is not forcing anymore `allowBackup` and `supportsRtl`, to let reading apps manage these features themselves (contributed by [@twaddington](https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-kotlin/pull/93)).

#### Streamer

* The EPUB parser underwent a significant refactoring to fix a number of issues (contributed by [@qnga](https://github.com/readium/r2-streamer-kotlin/pull/89))
  * [Metadata parsing was updated to follow our up-to-date specifications](https://github.com/readium/r2-streamer-kotlin/pull/102).
  * XML namespace prefixes are now properly supported, when an author chooses unusual ones.
  * Similarly, default vocabularies and prefixes for EPUB 3 Property Data Types are now properly handled.
* [`Server` was broken](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-kotlin/pull/306) when provided with publication filenames containing invalid characters.
* [EPUB publishers' default styles are not overriden by Readium CSS anymore](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-kotlin/issues/132).
* The `AndroidManifest.xml` is not forcing anymore `allowBackup` and `supportsRtl`, to let reading apps manage these features themselves (contributed by [@twaddington](https://github.com/readium/r2-streamer-kotlin/pull/93)).

#### LCP

* [`OutOfMemoryError` when downloading a large publication](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin/issues/70). This fix removed the dependency to [Fuel](https://github.com/kittinunf/fuel).
* The `AndroidManifest.xml` is not forcing anymore `allowBackup` and `supportsRtl`, to let reading apps manage these features themselves (contributed by [@twaddington](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin/pull/63)).
