Using JitPack \u00b6 If you are integrating Readium with the JitPack Maven repository, the same Readium modules are available as before. Just replace the former dependency notations with the new ones, per the README . dependencies { implementation \"com.github.readium.kotlin-toolkit:readium-shared:$readium_version\" implementation \"com.github.readium.kotlin-toolkit:readium-streamer:$readium_version\" implementation \"com.github.readium.kotlin-toolkit:readium-navigator:$readium_version\" implementation \"com.github.readium.kotlin-toolkit:readium-opds:$readium_version\" implementation \"com.github.readium.kotlin-toolkit:readium-lcp:$readium_version\" } Using a fork \u00b6 If you are integrating your own forks of the Readium modules, you will need to migrate them to a single fork and port your changes. Follow strictly the given steps and it should go painlessly. Upgrade your forks to the latest Readium 2.1.0 version from the legacy repositories, as you would with any update. The 2.1.0 version is available on both the legacy repositories and the new kotlin-toolkit one. It will be used to port your changes over to the single repository. Fork the new kotlin-toolkit repository on your own GitHub space. In a new local directory, clone your legacy forks as well as the new single fork: ```sh mkdir readium-migration cd readium-migration Clone the legacy forks \u00b6 git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/r2-shared-kotlin.git git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/r2-streamer-kotlin.git git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/r2-navigator-kotlin.git git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/r2-opds-kotlin.git git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/r2-lcp-kotlin.git Clone the new single fork \u00b6 git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/kotlin-toolkit.git 4. Reset the new fork to be in the same state as the 2.1.0 release. sh cd kotlin-toolkit git reset --hard 2.1.0 5. For each Readium module, port your changes over to the new fork. sh rm -rf readium/*/src cp -r ../r2-shared-kotlin/r2-shared/src readium/shared cp -r ../r2-streamer-kotlin/r2-streamer/src readium/streamer cp -r ../r2-navigator-kotlin/r2-navigator/src readium/navigator cp -r ../r2-opds-kotlin/r2-opds/src readium/opds cp -r ../r2-lcp-kotlin/r2-lcp/src readium/lcp 6. Review your changes, then commit. sh git add readium git commit -m \"Apply local changes to Readium\" 7. Finally, pull the changes to upgrade to the latest version of the fork. You might need to fix some conflicts. sh git pull --rebase git push ``` Your fork is now ready! To integrate it in your app as a local Git clone or submodule, follow the instructions from the README . 2.0.0 \u00b6 Nothing to change in your app to upgrade from 2.0.0-beta.2 to the final 2.0.0 release! Please follow the relevant sections if you are upgrading from an older version. 2.0.0-beta.2 \u00b6 This new beta is the last one before the final 2.0.0 release. It is mostly focused on bug fixes but we also adjusted the LCP and HTTP server APIs before setting it in stone for the 2.x versions. Serving publications with the HTTP server \u00b6 The API used to serve Publication resources with the Streamer's HTTP server was simplified. See the test app changes in PR #387 . Replace addEpub() with addPublication() , which does not expect the publication filename anymore. If the Publication is servable, addPublication() will return its base URL. This means that you do not need to: Call Publication.localBaseUrlOf() to get the base URL. Use the one returned by addPublication() instead. Set the server port in the $key-publicationPort SharedPreferences property. If you copied the R2ScreenReader from the test app, you will need to update it to use directly the base URL instead of the $key-publicationPort property. See this commit . R2EpubActivity and R2AudiobookActivity are expecting an additional Intent extra: baseUrl . Use the base URL returned by addPublication() . LCP changes \u00b6 Find all the changes made in the test app related to LCP in PR #379 . Replacing org.joda.time.DateTime with java.util.Date \u00b6 We replaced all occurrences of Joda's DateTime with java.util.Date in r2-lcp-kotlin , to reduce the dependency on third-party libraries. You will need to update any code using LcpLicense . The easiest way would be to keep using Joda in your own app and create DateTime object from the Date ones. For example: lcpLicense ?. license ?. issued ?. let { DateTime ( it ) } Revamped loan renew API \u00b6 The API to renew an LCP loan got revamped to better support renewal through a web page. You will need to implement LcpLicense.RenewListener to coordinate the UX interaction. For Material Design apps \u00b6 If your application fits Material Design guidelines, you may use the provided MaterialRenewListener implementation directly. This will only work if your theme extends a MaterialComponents one, for example: <style name= \"AppTheme\" parent= \"Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.DarkActionBar\" > MaterialRenewListener expects an ActivityResultCaller instance for argument. Any ComponentActivity or Fragment object can be used as ActivityResultCaller . val activity : FragmentActivity license . renewLoan ( MaterialRenewListener ( license = lcpLicense , caller = activity , fragmentManager = activity . supportFragmentManager )) 2.0.0-beta.1 \u00b6 The version 2.0.0-beta.1 is mostly stabilizing the new APIs and fixing existing bugs. We also upgraded the libraries to be compatible with Kotlin 1.4 and Gradle 4.1. Replacing Format by MediaType \u00b6 To simplify the new format API, we merged Format into MediaType to offer a single interface. If you were using Format , you should be able to replace it by MediaType seamlessly. Replacing File by FileAsset \u00b6 Streamer.open() is now expecting an implementation of PublicationAsset instead of an instance of File . This allows to open publications which are not represented as files on the device. For example a stream, an URL or any other custom structure. Readium ships with a default implementation named FileAsset replacing the previous File type. The API is the same so you can just replace File by FileAsset in your project. Support for display cutouts \u00b6 This new version is now compatible with display cutouts . However, this is an opt-in feature . To support display cutouts, follow these instructions: IMPORTANT : You need to remove any setPadding() statement from your app in UserSettings.kt , if you copied it from the test app. If you embed a navigator fragment (e.g. EpubNavigatorFragment ) yourself, you need to opt-in by specifying the layoutInDisplayCutoutMode of the host Activity . R2EpubActivity and R2CbzActivity automatically apply LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_SHORT_EDGES to their window's layoutInDisplayCutoutMode . PdfNavigatorFragment is not yet compatible with display cutouts, because of limitations from the underlying PDF viewer. 2.0.0-alpha.2 \u00b6 The 2.0.0 introduces numerous new APIs in the Shared Models, Streamer and LCP libraries, which are detailed in the following proposals. We highly recommend skimming over the \"Developer Guide\" section of each proposal before upgrading to this new major version. Format API Composite Fetcher API Publication Encapsulation Publication Helpers and Services Streamer API Content Protection This r2-testapp-kotlin commit showcases all the changes required to upgrade the Test App. Please reach out on Slack if you have any issue migrating your app to Readium 2.0.0, after checking the troubleshooting section . Replacing the Parsers with Streamer \u00b6 A new Streamer class deprecates the use of individual PublicationParser implementations, which you will need to replace in your app. Opening a Publication \u00b6 Call Streamer::open() to parse a publication. It will return a self-contained Publication model which handles metadata, resource access and DRM decryption. This means that Container , PubBox and DRM are not needed anymore, you can remove any reference from your app. The allowUserInteraction parameter should be set to true if you intend to render the parsed publication to the user. It will allow the Streamer to display interactive dialogs, for example to enter DRM credentials. You can set it to false if you're parsing a publication in a background process, for example during bulk import. val streamer = Streamer ( context ) val publication = streamer . open ( File ( path ), allowUserInteraction = true ) . getOrElse { error -> alert ( error . getUserMessage ( context )) return } Parsing a Readium Web Publication Manifest \u00b6 You can't use Publication.fromJSON() to parse directly a manifest anymore. Instead, you can use Manifest.fromJSON() , which gives you access to the metadata embedded in the manifest. Then, if you really need a Publication model, you can build one yourself from the Manifest and optionally a Fetcher and Publication Services. -val publication = Publication.fromJSON(json) +val publication = Manifest.fromJSON(json)?.let { Publication(it) } However, the best way to parse a RWPM is to use the Streamer , like with any other publication format. This way the Publication model will be initialized with appropriate Fetcher and Publication Services. Error Feedback \u00b6 In case of failure, a Publication.OpeningException is returned. It implements UserException and can be used directly to present an error message to the user with getUserMessage(Context) . If you wish to customize the error messages or add translations, you can override the strings declared in r2-shared-kotlin/r2-shared/src/main/res/values/strings.xml in your own app module. This goes for LCP errors as well, which are declared in r2-lcp-kotlin/r2-lcp/src/main/res/values/strings.xml . Advanced Usage \u00b6 Streamer offers other useful APIs to extend the capabilities of the Readium toolkit. Take a look at its documentation for more details, but here's an overview: Add new custom parsers. Integrated DRM support, such as LCP. Provide different implementations for third-party tools, e.g. ZIP, PDF and XML. Customize the Publication 's metadata or Fetcher upon creation. Collect authoring warnings from parsers. Accessing a Publication's Resources \u00b6 Container is Deprecated \u00b6 Since the new Publication model is self-contained, you can replace any use of the Container API by publication.get(Link) . This works for any publication format supported by the Streamer 's parsers. The test app used to have special cases for DiViNa and Audiobooks, by unpacking manually the ZIP archives. You should remove this code and streamline any resource access using publication.get() . Extracting Publication Covers \u00b6 Extracting the cover of a publication for caching purposes can be done with a single call to publication.cover() , instead of reaching for a Link with cover relation. You can use publication.coverFitting(Size) to select the best resolution without exceeding a given size. It can be useful to avoid saving very large cover images. -val cover = - try { - publication.coverLink - ?.let { container.data(it.href) } - ?.let { BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(it, 0, it.size) } - } catch (e: Exception) { - null - } +val cover = publication.coverFitting(Size(width = 100, height = 100)) Observing a Navigator's Current Locator \u00b6 Navigator::currentLocator is now a StateFlow instead of LiveData , to better support chromeless navigators such as an audiobook navigator in the future. If you were observing currentLocator from an Activity or Fragment , you can continue to do so with currentLocator.asLiveData() . - navigator.currentLocator.observe(this, Observer { locator -> }) + navigator.currentLocator.asLiveData().observe(this, Observer { locator -> }) If you access directly the value through navigator.currentLocator.value , you might need to add the following annotation to the enclosing class: @OptIn(kotlinx.coroutines.ExperimentalCoroutinesApi::class) Despite being still experimental, StateFlow is deemed stable for use . LCP and Other DRMs \u00b6 Opening an LCP Protected Publication \u00b6 Support for LCP is now fully integrated with the Streamer , which means that you don't need to retrieve the LCP license and fill container.drm yourself after opening a Publication anymore. To enable the support for LCP in the Streamer , you need to initialize it with a ContentProtection implementation provided by r2-lcp-kotlin . val lcpService = LcpService ( context ) val streamer = Streamer ( context = context , contentProtections = listOfNotNull ( lcpService ?. contentProtection () ) ) Then, to prompt the user for their passphrase, you need to set allowUserInteraction to true and provide the instance of the hosting Activity , Fragment or View with the sender parameter when opening the publication. streamer . open ( File ( path ), allowUserInteraction = true , sender = activity ) Alternatively, if you already have the passphrase, you can pass it directly to the credentials parameter. If it's valid, the user won't be prompted. Customizing the Passphrase Dialog \u00b6 The LCP Service now ships with a default passphrase dialog. You can remove the former implementation from your app if you copied it from the test app. But if you still want to use a custom implementation of LcpAuthenticating , for example to have a different layout, you can pass it when creating the ContentProtection . lcpService . contentProtection ( CustomLCPAuthentication ()) Presenting a Protected Publication with a Navigator \u00b6 In case the credentials were incorrect or missing, the Streamer will still return a Publication , but in a \"restricted\" state. This allows reading apps to import publications by accessing their metadata without having the passphrase. But if you need to present the publication with a Navigator, you will need to first check if the Publication is not restricted. Besides missing credentials, a publication can be restricted if the Content Protection returned an error, for example when the publication is expired. In which case, you must display the error to the user by checking the presence of a publication.protectionError . if ( publication . isRestricted ) { publication . protectionError ?. let { error -> // A status error occurred, for example the publication expired alert ( error . getUserMessage ( context )) } } else { presentNavigator ( publication ) } Accessing an LCP License Information \u00b6 To check if a publication is protected with a known DRM, you can use publication.isProtected . If you need to access an LCP license's information, you can use the helper publication.lcpLicense , which will return the LcpLicense if the publication is protected with LCP and the passphrase was known. Alternatively, you can use LcpService::retrieveLicense() as before. Acquiring a Publication from an LCPL \u00b6 LcpService.importPublication() was replaced with acquirePublication() , which is a cancellable suspending function. It doesn't require the user to enter its passphrase anymore to download the publication. Supporting Other DRMs \u00b6 You can integrate additional DRMs, such as Adobe ACS, by implementing the ContentProtection protocol. This will provide first-class support for this DRM in the Streamer and Navigator. Take a look at the Content Protection proposal for more details. An example implementation can be found in r2-lcp-kotlin . Introducing Try \u00b6 A few of the new APIs are returning a Try object, which is similar to the native Result type . We decided to go for this opiniated approach for error handling instead of throwing Exception because of the type-safety it brings and the constraint on reading apps to properly handle error cases. You can revert to traditional exceptions by calling getOrThrow() on the Try instance, but the most convenient way to handle the error would be to use getOrElse() . val publication = streamer . open ( File ( path ), allowUserInteraction = true ) . getOrElse { error -> alert ( error . getUserMessage ( context )) return } Try also supports map() and flatMap() which are useful to transform the result while forwarding any error handling to upper layers. fun cover (): Try < Bitmap , ResourceException > = publication . get ( coverLink ) . use { resource -> resource . read () } // <- returns a Try<ByteArray, ResourceException> . map { bytes -> BitmapFactory . decodeByteArray ( bytes , 0 , bytes . size ) } Troubleshooting \u00b6 Attempt to invoke virtual method ' android.content.SharedPreferences android.content.Context.getSharedPreferences(java.lang.String, int) ' on a null object reference \u00b6 Make sure you create the LcpService after onCreate() has been called on an Activity . LCP publications are blank or LCPL are not imported \u00b6 Make sure you added the following to your app's build.gradle : implementation \"readium:liblcp:1.0.0@aar\" LCP publications are opening but not decrypted \u00b6 Make sure you added the content protection to the Streamer, following these instructions . E/LcpDialogAuthentication: No valid [sender] was passed to LcpDialogAuthentication::retrievePassphrase() . Make sure it is an Activity, a Fragment or a View. \u00b6 To be able to present the LCP passphrase dialog, the default LcpDialogAuthentication needs a hosting view as context. You must provide it to the sender parameter of Streamer::open() . streamer . open ( File ( path ), allowUserInteraction = true , sender = activity ) IllegalArgumentException: The provided publication is restricted. Check that any DRM was properly unlocked using a Content Protection. \u00b6 Navigators will refuse to be opened if a publication is protected and not unlocked. You must check if a publication is not restricted by following these instructions . 2.0.0-alpha.1 \u00b6 With this new release, we started a process of modernization of the Readium Kotlin toolkit to: better follow Android best practices and Kotlin conventions, reduce coupling between reading apps and Readium, to ease future migrations and allow refactoring of private core implementations, increase code safety, unify Readium APIs across platforms through public specifications . As such, this release will break existing codebases . While most changes are facilitated thanks to deprecation warnings with automatic fixes, there are a few changes listed below that you will need to operate manually. Imports \u00b6 The Publication shared models were moved to their own package. While there are deprecated aliases helping with migration, it doesn't work for Publication.EXTENSION . Therefore, you need to replace all occurrences of org.readium.r2.shared.Publication by org.readium.r2.shared.publication.Publication in your codebase. Or better, don't use Publication.EXTENSION anymore. We have a new Format API which handles these needs in a more systematic way . And instead of file extensions, we recommend to store media types in your database. A few Publication and Link properties, such as images , pageList and numberOfItems were moved to a different package. Simply trigger the \"Import\" feature of your IDE to resolve them. Immutability of Shared Models \u00b6 The Publication shared models are now immutable to increase code safety. This should not impact reading apps much unless you were creating Publication or other models yourself. However, there are a few places in the Test App that needs to be updated: Publication 's readingOrder , links , and tableOfContents are not MutableList anymore, but read-only List . Therefore, you need to update any code expecting mutable lists . Locator can't be modified directly anymore. Instead, use the copy() or copyWithLocations() Locator APIs . Last Read Location \u00b6 Best practices on observing and restoring the last location were updated in the Test App, and it is highly recommended that you update your codebase as well, to avoid any issues. Restoring the Last Location \u00b6 You need to make these changes in your implementations of EpubActivity , ComicActivity and AudiobookActivity : Remove any overrides of currentLocation . Restore the last location from your database in onCreate() , for example with something similar to: // Restores the last read location bookRepository . lastLocatorOfBook ( bookId ) ?. let { locator -> go ( locator , animated = false ) } Observing the Current Location \u00b6 NavigatorDelegate.locationDidChange() is now deprecated in favor of the more idiomatic Navigator.currentLocator: LiveData<Locator?> . currentLocator . observe ( this , Observer { locator -> if ( locator != null ) { bookRepository . saveLastLocatorOfBook ( bookId , locator ) } }) Publication \u00b6 A new Positions List feature was added to provide a list of discrete locations in a publication. It can be used to implement an approximation of page numbers. This replaces the existing R2SyntheticPageList , which should be removed from your codebase. Publications parsed from large manifests could crash the application when starting a reading activity. To fix this, Publication must not be put in an Intent extra anymore . Instead, use the new Intent extensions provided by Readium . This solution is a crutch until we move away from Activity in the Navigator and let reading apps handle the lifecycle of Publication themselves. Replace all occurrences of putExtra(\"publication\", publication) or similar by putPublication(publication) . Replace all occurrences of getSerializableExtra(\"publication\") or similar by getPublication(this) . Locator \u00b6 Locator is now Parcelable instead of Serializable , you must replace all occurrences of getSerializableExtra(\"locator\") by getParcelableExtra(\"locator\") . Locations.fragment was renamed to fragments , and is now a List . You need to update your code if you were creating Locations yourself. locations and text are not nullable anymore. Locator 's constructor has a default value, so you don't need to pass null for them anymore . Locator is not meant to be subclassed, and extending it is not possible anymore. If your project is based on the Test App, you need to do the following changes in your codebase : Don't extend Locator in Bookmark and Highlight . Instead, add a locator property which will create a Locator object from their properties. Then, in places where you were creating a Locator from a database model , you can use this property directly. For SearchLocator , you have two choices: (Recommended) Replace all occurrences of SearchLocator by Locator . These two models are interchangeable. Use the same strategy described above for Bookmark . class Bookmark (...) { val locator get () = Locator ( href = resourceHref , type = resourceType , title = resourceTitle , locations = location , text = locatorText ) } Server \u00b6 The CSS, JavaScript and fonts injection in the Server was refactored to reduce the risk of collisions and simplify your codebase. This is a breaking change , to upgrade your app you need to : Provide the application's Context when creating a Server . Remove the following injection statements, which are now handled directly by the Streamer: server . loadCustomResource ( assets . open ( \"scripts/crypto-sha256.js\" ), \"crypto-sha256.js\" , Injectable . Script ) server . loadCustomResource ( assets . open ( \"scripts/highlight.js\" ), \"highlight.js\" , Injectable .

R2RTLViewPager \u00b6 [androidJvm]\\ open class R2RTLViewPager : ViewPager RtlViewPager is an API-compatible implementation of ViewPager which orders paged views according to the layout direction of the view. In left to right mode, the first view is at the left side of the carousel, and in right to left mode it is at the right side. It accomplishes this by wrapping the provided PagerAdapter and any provided OnPageChangeListeners so that clients can be agnostic to layout direction and modifications are kept internal to RtlViewPager.
