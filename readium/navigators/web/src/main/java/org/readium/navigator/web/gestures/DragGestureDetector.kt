/**
 * A Gesture detector that waits for pointer down and touch slop in the direction specified by
 * [orientationLock] and then calls [onDrag] for each drag event.
 * It follows the touch slop detection of [awaitTouchSlopOrCancellation] but will consume the
 * position change automatically once the touch slop has been crossed, the amount of drag over
 * the touch slop is reported as the first drag event [onDrag] after the slop is crossed.
 * If [shouldAwaitTouchSlop] returns true the touch slop recognition phase will be ignored
 * and the drag gesture will be recognized immediately.The first [onDrag] in this case will report
 * an [Offset.Zero].
 *
 * [onDragStart] is called when the touch slop has been passed and includes an [Offset] representing
 * the last known pointer position relative to the containing element as well as  the initial
 * down event that triggered this gesture detection cycle. The [Offset] can be outside
 * the actual bounds of the element itself meaning the numbers can be negative or larger than the
 * element bounds if the touch target is smaller than the
 * [ViewConfiguration.minimumTouchTargetSize].
 *
 * [onDragEnd] is called after all pointers are up with the event change of the up event
 * and [onDragCancel] is called if another gesture has consumed pointer input,
 * canceling this gesture.
 *
 * @param onDragStart A lambda to be called when the drag gesture starts, it contains information
 * about the last known [PointerInputChange] relative to the containing element and the post slop
 * delta.
 * @param onDragEnd A lambda to be called when the gesture ends. It contains information about the
 * up [PointerInputChange] that finished the gesture.
 * @param onDragCancel A lambda to be called when the gesture is cancelled either by an error or
 * when it was consumed.
 * @param shouldAwaitTouchSlop Indicates if touch slop detection should be skipped.
 * @param orientationLock Optionally locks detection to this orientation, this means, when this is
 * provided, touch slop detection and drag event detection will be conditioned to the given
 * orientation axis. [onDrag] will still dispatch events on with information in both axis, but
 * if orientation lock is provided, only events that happen on the given orientation will be
 * considered. If no value is provided (i.e. null) touch slop and drag detection will happen on
 * an "any" orientation basis, that is, touch slop will be detected if crossed in either direction
 * and drag events will be dispatched if present in either direction.
 * @param onDrag A lambda to be called for each delta event in the gesture. It contains information
 * about the [PointerInputChange] and the movement offset.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.samples.DetectDragGesturesSample
 *
 * @see detectVerticalDragGestures
 * @see detectHorizontalDragGestures
 * @see detectDragGesturesAfterLongPress to detect gestures after long press
