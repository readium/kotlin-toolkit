/**
 * Wraps a [Resource] and buffers its content.
 *
 * Expensive interaction with the underlying resource is minimized, since most (smaller) requests
 * can be satisfied by accessing the buffer alone. The drawback is that some extra space is required
 * to hold the buffer and that copying takes place when filling that buffer, but this is usually
 * outweighed by the performance benefits.
 *
 * Note that this implementation is pretty limited and the benefits are only apparent when reading
 * forward and consecutively â€“ e.g. when downloading the resource by chunks. The buffer is ignored
 * when reading backward or far ahead.
 *
 * @param resource Underlying resource which will be buffered.
 * @param resourceLength The total length of the resource, when known. This can improve performance
 *        by avoiding requesting the length from the underlying resource.
 * @param bufferSize Size of the buffer chunks to read.
