 * An interface for channels that keep a pointer to a current position within an underlying

 * <p>SeekableByteChannels have a pointer into the underlying data source which is referred to as a
 * <em>position</em>. The position can be manipulated by moving it within the data source, and the
 * current position can be queried.
 *
 * <p>SeekableByteChannels also have an associated <em>size</em>. The size of the channel is the
 * number of bytes that the data source currently contains. The size of the data source can be
 * manipulated by adding more bytes to the end or by removing bytes from the end. See
 * {@link #truncate}, {@link #position} and {@link #write} for details. The current size can also
 * be queried.
